# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

This is based on a starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim), with some modifications to work with R files. This configuration is based off of the one from [Dan Kelley](https://github.com/dankelley/nvim.git). Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started with lazyvim.

While I'm not 100% sure why this happened, it seems to be a defaults change in LazyVim so that the nvim-cmp plugin is no longer enabled by default. To fix, open nvim, hit "x" to get the Extras menu, navigate to find `coding.nvim-cmp`, and hit "x" to enable it.

On the other hand, the completion engine that seems to be provided as default now ([Blink])[https://www.lazyvim.org/extras/coding/blink] actually seems pretty good! Maybe I should try it for awhile.

## fzf instead of telescope as default in LazyVim 14.0

See:

https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim/releases/tag/v14.0.0

where fzf is now the default "picker" in LazyVim, instead of telescope. In order to get a new enough version on Ubuntu 22.04 I had to install homebrew and install it that way.

## 2024-12-17: Some stuff I've been learning:

* open a terminal in the root directory with <leader>ft and in the current directory with <leader>fT.
* open a file browser split with neo-tree in root using <leader>e and in cwd with <leader>E
  * to show hidden files in the neo-tree type H
* open a buffer explorer with <leader>be
* switch between splits using: Ctrl-j/k/h/l
* cancel a split with Ctrl-w q.
