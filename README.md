# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

This is based on a starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim), with some modifications to work with R files. This configuration is based off of the one from [Dan Kelley](https://github.com/dankelley/nvim.git). Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started with lazyvim.
