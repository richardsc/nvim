# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

This is based on a starter template for
[LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim), with some modifications
to work with R files. Refer to the
[documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get
started with lazyvim.  I have some notes on how I transitioned from
lunarvim on my blog at 
[https://dankelley.github.io/dek_blog/2024/07/06/setting-up-lazyvim.html](https://dankelley.github.io/dek_blog/2024/07/06/setting-up-lazyvim.html).
